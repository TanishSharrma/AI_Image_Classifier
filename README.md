# Image-Classification-by-Keras-and-Tensorflow
Image Classification using Keras as well as Tensorflow. Image Classification is a Machine Learning module that trains itself from an existing dataset of multiclass images and develops a model for future prediction of similar images not encountered during training. Developed using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
